# Airplane Inheritance Project (C++)

## Description
This project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in C++, with a focus on inheritance and polymorphism.  
It models different types of airplanes using a base `Airplane` class and derived classes.
## Project Structure
```text
├── Airplane.h
├── Airplane.cpp
├── PassengerPlane.h
├── PassengerPlane.cpp
├── CargoPlane.h
├── CargoPlane.cpp
├── Main.cpp
```
## Concepts Used
- Classes and objects  
- Inheritance  
- Polymorphism  
- Virtual functions  
- Method overriding  
- Encapsulation  

## How It Works
- `Airplane` defines common attributes and behaviors shared by all airplanes.
- `PassengerPlane` and `CargoPlane` inherit from `Airplane` and customize functionality.
- `Main.cpp` demonstrates polymorphism by working with airplane objects through base-class references.
